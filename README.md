mutual aid for people who are not employed
a support group for people searching for jobs
a labor union for the unemployed

Core values:
- we believe that everyone is deserve of a job
- we are simply trying to survive in capitalism, not thrive
- we need to survive within capitalism to eventually build our own utopia
- we are here to support each other through the resources we do have which are not necessarily monetary
- we are here to remind ourselves that we are human beings and not human doings; we are not simply cogs within the capitalist machine
- we are stronger together than we are apart
- job searching as team sport
- we can take a stand together against those who have bad hiring practices
- meritocracy is a fallacy
- we are living within capitalism
- it is okay if you are here because you're just looking for a way to put food on the table
- your job does not need to be your calling
- your job does not make you who you are
- we are trying to survive within capitalism by actively dismantling it.
